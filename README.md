# Scholarly XML

Scholarly XML is a VSCode extension with a relaxNG validator and autocomplete with features typically needed by academic encoding projects.

Unlike most XML VScode extensions, Scholarly XML _does not require Java_. The extension builds on [Salve](https://github.com/mangalam-research/salve), a node relaxNG implementation. This makes Scholarly XML easy to install for use with students, in workshop, and in minimal computing projects.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
